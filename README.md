## About The Project
- ï¼­anaged the global state by leveraging Redux(RTK), utilizing Redux Thunk to handle asynchronous data requests, enabling smooth data flow handling.
- Used TypeScript to ensure type safety and mitigate potential issues caused by incorrect data type.
- Implemented B[number] backlinks like B2 or B18 to enable reply threading, allowing users to reply to specific comments(inspired by Dcard). Clicking a backlink will lead to the corresponding comment and highlight it, providing a visual cue to its location.
- Implemented a multi-filtering system and especially integrated platform-specific filters from popular streaming services like Netflix, Disney+, LINE TV, and more. This provides users with a personalized and relevant selection of dramas based on their preferences. 
- Implemented a comprehensive User Management System with Firebase Authentication and seamlessly integrated data management using Firebase Firestore Database.
- Improved real-time search by using Debounce. Reduced duplicate filter calls on onChange events, resulting in fewer API requests and improved UX.
- Incorporated the provided iframes from Spotify and YouTube, enabling users to include the respective soundtracks and trailers for each drama, providing a more immersive experience for users.
- Utilized the third-party libraries, Quill and SweetAlert2. Quill served as the editor for posting articles on the forum, and SweetAlert2 was used to create visually appealing and interactive pop-up alerts.
- Implemented features such as infinite scroll, skeleton loading, and pagination to enhance UX and optimize website performance.
- Maintained the practice of documenting bugs and their resolutions on corresponding Trello cards, meanwhile utilizing Trello's power-up plugin to effectively manage project timelines.
